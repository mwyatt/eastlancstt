The teenagers Charlie McGrath &amp; Ben Farrar have taken a big leap from Division 2 to play for the Hyndburn side and not done too badly so far either, but even with the experienced campaigners of Mick Moir &amp; Graham Young playing alongside it would be a big ask for them to gain the honours of champions this season. It is great though what coach Mick Moir is doing bringing on the league’s young talent. The only other unbeaten side East Lancs with 3/3 may also have their own aspirations after a good start.

Unbeaten though with 3/3 and looking to challenge again after just missing promotion last year are the ever experienced ‘Old Masters’. The Lions demoted from the Premier will hope to boomerang back up but with a win and a draw so far may have now realised they can’t take it for granted. Last years Div 2 champions KSB C (were ‘B’ last year), have found the step up a division a difficult adjustment and could struggle having already lost 4/4.

But the favourites for the division title will be Tackyfire who are also unbeaten with 3/3 after playing perhaps stronger teams early on than the two teams currently above them. It’s hard to tell the form of some teams having already fallen a few fixtures behind, but Whalley Falcons having played 3 and lost 3 look as if they are going to have a long difficult campaign<br><p><br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>Team Played Won Drawn Lost Pts<br><p>1.

All the other 6 teams in division 3 have added to the league new players this year and all have competed well so far and will continue to improve. That is especially the case for the new youngsters of Hyndburn F who are already showing they have some good skills which when harnessed will begin to win games in the future.<br><p><br><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

KSB ‘B’ led forward by Ray Kay (3/3) are also setting their sights on promotion as they won 22:9 v their club colleagues KSB ‘C’. Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ lost a little hope in the promotion battle losing this week to HSC 13:23 with HSC’s Frank Hamer in good form and winning all his games.

Clitheroe A, featuring Phil Riley, Dave Kay &amp; Mark Hanson also started in devestating fashion with a 30:2 thrashing of the Lions.

David Eastwood with 3 wins helped Brierfield win away 23:13 against Net N Edges, though a fine unbeaten performance by Jack Keogh including a close 3:2 win over Barry hall was not enough for Brierfiled to avoid defeat to Old Masters 18:21.<p><h2>Second Division</h2><p>Tackyfire have made a good start and are on top of division 2 being the only team having played two and won two with a  28:8 v Slayers and in a closer match beat Div 2 newcomers Doals Army 20:17.

A quickly improving crop of young players Benn Farrar, Charlie McGrath &amp; Ben Duffy coached By Mick Moir playing for Hyndburn D this year, had a impressive win 25:16 verses Whalley Kestrals with Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie picking up a max 9 points each. Another promising young team is the lads Keiran Cunliffe, Adam Robinson and Jim Atherton who make up Whalley Hawks and had a good win v KSB D 24:17 with Keiran undefeated on the night.  KSB ‘D’ had better fortunes as they beat Adpak Aces 26:13.<p><h2>Third Division</h2><p>In Division 3 with Ian Mills in great form having won his first 6 games  with the loss of just 1 set helped Doals Marauders to the top of the table with two good wins  21:17 v clubmates Rolling Doals, and followed it with a 26:6 v newcomers Hyndburn F, though the young newcomers showed enough to indicate they will improve very quickly! KSB E had a close win 19:17 v club friends KSB F though Ross Erwin lost to an impressive Carlton Cooper who got 100% on the night.

Keith Lee won all 3 to help Burnley Boys triumph 26:16 over Ramsbottom B who had a miserable week also losing to Hyndburn TTC A 9:26. Hyndburn A made it two out of two thrashing Ward &amp; Stobbart 30:4 as Michael Moir finished a week undefeated in the two fixtures. Newly promoted Hyndburners gained their first win on top of a great performance from Duncan Rigby winning 3/3 in a 25:16 victory over The Lions.<p><p>In div 1 Hyndburn TTC B are top after 3 games despite losing in a close battle 18:20 to last season’s div 2 champions Clitheroe B who have made a great start in the higher division with 3 wins out of 3 but still have 1 point less than Hyndburn B. The player of this tight contest was Dave Allen for the losers who won his 3/3. HSC are also unbeaten with 2/2 wins, overcoming KSB C this week 24:16, with Fred Coghlan again winning all his games. A masterly performance from Ian Beecroft unbeaten for Nets N Edges helped them in an away win over the Old Masters 20:17.<p><p>Tackyfire are still top of Div 2 having played a game more than the rest but it looks like the two young teams Hyndburn D &amp; Whalley Hawks may be the ones to watch as the only teams yet unbeaten after two games. The young Hawks were victorious 20:17 over Tackyfire, though on fire was Elton Akins with 3/3 who made it closer than it would have been otherwise for the losers. A rapidly improving Ben Duffy was unlucky on the night losing 3 games all 2:3 , but still saw his team Hyndburn D win 25:15 v Adpak Aces as Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie McGrath took maximum points each.

But Ramsbottom A go top!', 'Ramsbottom A sit top of the Premier this week with 4/4 wins after winning a tight ‘derby’ game v club mates Ramsbottom B 25:20, in which 5 of the games went to the wire in the 5th set. Player of the match though was Martin Holt for the B team with a fine 3/3 wins. In second place are Hyndburn TTC A with 3/3 wins, this week overcoming Hyndburners 22:12 with a 100% evening for Mick Moir &amp; 3 wins also for Andrew Jackson. Young Ben Duffy standing in as reserve for the winners did well in stepping up two divisions to take a set off Fred Wade. Another unbeaten team are Burnley Boys Club who with Martin Wyatt untouchable on the night beat Ward &amp; Stobbart away 24:13. Only having played 2 but also unbeaten so far are Clitheroe LMC A, who were victorious 26:15 over early strugglers East Lancs on the back of 3 good wins from Phil Riley. Adam Blezard won 3/3 to help Rovers to their first win of the season 28:12 v The Lions. <p><p>The Old Masters currently sit top of division 1, and have had consecutive wins away to KSB C 26:13 with John Thornber &amp; Barry Hall 3/3 and followed it at home 25:16 v Clitheroe LMC B this time with Roger Whewell the player of the match with 3 wins. With 2 games in hand though and likely to challenge the top spots are KSB A &amp; HSC who are the only teams in the division unbeaten but having only played 3 games. Matt Hirst for KSB A again winning 3/3 led them in a 21:15 win over Hyndburn TTC B, whilst HSC won 22:17 v Whalley Eagles spurred on by another 3 /3 wins from Fred Coghlan. Nets N Edges won this week v KSB C 26:13, following a loss  v KSB B 15:22. Man of the match in both of these was Net N Edges Ian Beecroft who is personally unbeaten in the season so far. KSB C are struggling in the higher division losing again 16:22 v Brierfield who were aided by Dave Eastwood winning all 3 games.<p><p>Only 3 matches to report on this week from Div 2 with Tackyfire still top though having another close loss this week 18:19 to Hyndburn TTC C with Bryan Edwards for Hyndburn showing he can still be useful when called upon winning all 3.

Doals Army are also going well early on and this week won v Adpak Aces 22:16 with Gerald Laxton &amp; Don Cunliffe leading the charge both winning 3/3.<p><p>Doals Marauders having managed to play all their 5 fixtures up to now losing only once are top of Division 3. Ian Mills unbeaten in their two wins this week, 21:19 v Doals Jetstream &amp; 23:12 v KSB F is in good form, though he lost his first singles game of the season to a thus far unbeaten Richard Staines ,as Marauders lost their first match to an impressive looking Hyndburn TTC E 14:22 with the Hyndburn juniors looking like they could feature in the promotion race. The other Hyndburn junior team ‘F’ won their first game 22:13 against other newcomers Doals Vikings. Zac Geldard won 3 for the victors but Paul Milnes also did well for the losers notching up his first two league singles wins.  Vikings had even less fortune v Hyndburn TTC E losing at home 9:29, as Elliot Simpson &amp; Burhan Khan went undefeated, though Vikings own promising junior Daniel O’Sullivan gained his first ever league singles win in only his second competitive match. Rolling Doals with Neil Hepworth &amp; Ryan Fallon unbeaten on the night ‘rolled’ over club mates Doals Jetstream 27:12.

Michael Moir for Hyndburn TTC A has started as he means to go on and sits top of the individual merit table. Table Tennis is a genuinely gender inclusive sport in which men and women play in the same league and it is good to see Mandy Winskill from Ramsbottom A up there in the top four merit table. <p><p>Old Masters lead the table in Division One but again it is HSC and KSB A with 100% records so far that are likely to challenging for promotion. Matt Hirst from KSB A will take some toppling and is already top of the Div one merit table.<p><p>KSB D are top of the table in Division two but as in the other divisions due to more games played than two other teams yet unbeaten. Whalley Hawks have played two and won two and this young team look like they will make a promotion challenge when they get more games in. Looking very impressive though, and my early tip to win the division is Hyndburn TTC D, another young team with Ben Farrer and Charlie McGrath both playing superbly and heading up the individual merit tables.<p><p>Doals Marauders having won 4 out of 5 are doing well and are top of Division Three, but of all the divisions the third looks the most open as perhaps any two from 6 teams could still emerge as the front runners. Hyndburn TTC E, another team of young people have started well and look promising, and KSB E as well as Whalley Phoenix are yet unbeaten.

This takes Hyndburn TTC D to the top of <strong>Division Two</strong> with 5/5 wins, but Whalley Hawks are still likely to remain their closest challengers. Whalley Kestrels showed they were no pushovers overcoming Tackyfire away 21:12 despite Elkin Akins winning all his games without loss for the losers.<p><p>The only result in from the <strong>Premier Division</strong> this week is East Lancs v Hyndburners, with the home team being triumphant 23:17 with no player unbeaten on the night.<p><p>In <strong>Division One</strong> Clitheroe LMC B notched up two good wins this week and go third. Bob Birch winning 3/3 helped them ease past KSB C 28:13 away, and then in a close game at home overcame HSC by 1 point 18:17. With 6 games played and just one loss perhaps Clitheroe who were promoted from div 2 this season are beginning to dream of promotion straight into the Premier! Just one other match to report in Division One in which Hyndburn TTC B triumphed 24:14 v Nets N Edges as David Allen won all his games. The Division looks wide open at present with just 7 points separating 5th place Hyndburn and top place Nets N Edges, yet unbeaten KSB A in 6th place but with 2 games in hand and only 26 points behind the top spot are likely to leap frog to the top once they catch up with fixtures.<p><p>KSB E won again convincingly 28:7 v Doals Vikings in <strong>Division Three</strong> as Michael Mullarkey and Ross Erwin were unbeaten to make it 5/5 straight wins and be the only unbeaten team in the division but still are a little of the pace of the promotion chase due to a lower total set points score despite their overall wins. Doals Marauders also won well v Doals Vikings 27:7 with Ian Mills &amp; Dominic Walsh gaining 3 wins each to keep themselves at the top of the table, despite losing in a very close game 20:21 to Whalley Falcons who had Kim Croyden in great form and man of the match with 3/3.

Reporting on the game Mike Turner said:  “you may want to mention an amazing recovery in the Division One relegation dog fight…The score was 13-12 to KSB, David Borland was playing really well and was leading Darius Mafi two  games to nil and was 8-0 up in the third game. Darius recovered brilliantly to win the game 13-11, and then go on to win 3-2. Andy Risk then beat Alan Calow in a five game thriller in the final singles to secure the KSB  victory  20:19” (Andy Risk, Darius Mafi 3/3). With Jack Keogh rolling back the years with fine unbeaten performances across two matches, Brierfield demonstrated their case for being counted in the promotion chase and go third after  two big wins this week: 27:9 v HSC, &amp; 27:11 away to Hyndburn TTC B (Dave Eastwood also 3/3 in the latter). KSB A increased their supremacy of the division with a 30:8 thrashing of a depleted Nets n Edges 30:9. KSB B beat Clitheroe LMC B 22:14 with Trevor Elkington &amp; Ray Kay unbeaten for the home team. Old Masters lived up to their name led by John Thornber with 3/3 as they won v Hyndburn TTC B 27:13.<p><p>Premier Division:<p>Just two matches this week. Ramsbottom B saw off East Lancs 26:11 with Neil Booth unbeaten for the victors after overcoming Matt Nettleton in a 5 set thriller in the game of the night.

Tackyfire were victors away over Adpak Aces 28:8 as Elkin Atkins &amp; Pak Wan were unbeaten &amp; KSB D maintained their lead of the division as they won 25:14 v Slayers with Neil McKinnon in great form scoring a 100% clean sheet on the night. With a reserve in place of the absent Charlie NcGrath the notable result of the week was Hyndburn TTC D losing for the first time as they went down 16:25 to their club mates Hyndburn TTC C, with Ben Farrar also losing his first game of the season 2:3 to a good performance from Roy Steventon who won 3/3 for the victors. Both Hyndburn sides look capable of a promotion challenge at present.<p><p>Division three:<p>Doals Jetstream hold onto their place at the top of the division with a 30:2 whitewash away to Hyndburn TTC F, with Bernie Milnes, Jon Andrews &amp; Bob Walker showing no mercy to the young beginners. But Rolling Doals are menacingly close with a game in hand and go second after a 28:2 win over club mates Doals Vikings with Ryan Fallon &amp; Peter Hepworth winning 3/3 each. Richard Staines much reported on in these despatches previously lost for the first time in the division and met his match against a very good Carlton Cooper who in winning all 3 again helped KSB F triumph as the beat Hyndburn TTC E 21:14. Whalley Falcons won the derby v Whalley Phoenix 25:8 as Kim Croydon took 3/3 and also new promising looking signing in Steve Nightingale also in his first match winning 3/3.

Burnley Boys Club are looking value for money for the second place spot and not surprisingly have two players in the top 5 merit places in Martin Wyatt (3rd) with 76% &amp; Andrea Harrison proving to be a leading lady in 5th spot with 63%. Clitheroe LMC A are in third place. Another lady going strong is Mandy Winskill of Ramsbottom A in 4th place in the merits with 63%.<p><p>KSB A unbeaten after 7 wins have a clear lead at top of Division One and look uncatchable as Matt Hirst with 83% &amp; Matt Hodgkinson with 81% sit 2nd &amp; 3rd respectively in the personal merit table.  Hyndburn TTC B are in second spot but the Old Masters have two games in hand and are in third place and may cherish a chance for promotion to the premier which would be a fine achievement for a team averaging somewhere near 80 years old each! Jack Keogh for Brierfield leads the merit table with an 86% average.<p><p>KSB D are top of the table in Division two with a strong lead at present and spurred on by an inform Neil McKinnon holding 2nd spot in the personal merit table with 79%. In second place are Hyndburn TTC D a team of young men led by the stylish Ben Farrar who in top lace of the div 2 merits with 80% is surely set to play at a high level in the coming years. Hyndburn TTC in 3rd place helped by Bryan Edwards 4th in the merits with 76% are capable of promotion if they could consistently field their strongest 3. It is close though with Tackyfire also a threat in 4th place with Elton Atkins going well with 78% and 3rd in the merit table. Whalley Hawks with games in hand can still challenge for a promotion place as well if the excellent young player Kieran Cunliffe stays on form who is presently features in the top 5 merits with 72% but capable of finishing higher than this. <p><p>The third division looks like an all Doals affair at present with 3 of their teams in the top 3. Doals Marauders &amp; Rolling Doals share top spot with 191 points each but the ‘Rollers’ have a game in hand. Ian Mills for Marauders is 3rd in the merits with 76% &amp; a much improved Ryan Fallon for Rolling Doals is 5th on 70%.  Doals Jetstream are in third place but the second half I fancy the juniors of Hyndburn E with first placed merit player Richard Staines on 86% can come on stronger and also Whalley Falcons with several games in hand look to have a strong squad and could rise much higher as well. KSB teams can’t be discounted either and have two players featuring in the merit table top 5, Carlton Cooper 2nd on 82% &amp; Ross Erwin 4th with 75%.<p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Burnley Boys Club sit worthily in 3rd spot after a closely fought away win 22:19 over Rovers, with no-one winning all 3 on the night climaxing with a great singles win 3:2 for Rovers Damon Blezard over Martin Wyatt. Ramsbottom A got over their disappointment at the hands of Clitheroe by a good comeback away win 27:7 v Hyndburners with the trio of Steve McNicholas,  Mandy Winskill &amp; Matthew Fields all unbeaten on the night. Another close game saw Ward Stobbart victors by two points away to Ramsbottom B, winning 22:20 with no-one winning all 3 personal games on night<p><p>Division One:<p>Matt Hirst, Matt Hodkinson, Dougie &amp; Daven Argile for KSB A are romping away with the first division unbeaten after 9 games with two more good home wins to start the new year 30:6 v club mates KSB C &amp; v Old Masters 28:11. <p>Barry Hall with 3/3 was too good to handle as Old Masters won a tight game away to HSC 19:17. Clitheroe B were unlucky to be on the losing side in two close games this period, going down 17:20 to Brierfield (Dave Eastwood for Brierfield 3/3), and again 18:21 to Whalley Eagles (Alan Calow for Eagles 3/3). Whalley Eagles who had no wins to report the first half of the season, have had a happy new year because as well as the win above v Clitheroe they also won 22:15 away to KSB B led by an unbeaten performance from David Borland. Hyndburn TTC B with a good 100% display by David Allen triumphed 21:13 v KSB B &amp;  Brierfield had a second win this time at home 26:12 v Nets N Edges as David Eastwood &amp; Peter Marshland both won all their games.<p><p>Division two:<p>A top of the table clash in Division two saw KSB D win at home v Whalley Hawks 24:18, led by Steve Horner winning 3/3 to keep them on top spot. Whalley Hawks though are presently second after other games this period winning their derby game v Whalley Kestrels 24:16 (3/3 Adam Robinson) &amp; in another promotion battle game narrowly won away 23:21 v Hyndburn TTC where no-one was unbeaten on the night and 5 games went to 5 sets. Hyndburn TTC though are in 3rd place just 4 points behind Hawks and kept the pressure on by a good away win 26:13 v Slayers with Bryan Edwards man of the match with 3/3. Hyndburn TTC D though currently in 5th spot have only lost 1 game and with a game in hand are not far of the pace of a promotion place following a decisive victory over Misfits away 28:9 (Ben Farrar, Charlie McGrath 3/3 each). Adpak Aces trio of Matthew Birch, Paul McGovern &amp; John Farrow  were indeed ‘Ace’ in a   good win over Whalley Kestrels 19:16 despite an inform Martin Drury for Kestrels gaining 100% on the night, who also got 3/3  along with Alan Ross in a fine 27:9 away win v Doals Army.<p><p> <p>Division three:<p>The second half of the season began with a top of the table clash and club derby in Division three between Rolling Doals &amp; Doals Marauders, with a more decisive win than expected by the Rolling trio of Ryan Fallon, Peter &amp; Neil Hepworth by 27:13. This leaves Rolling Doals clear at the top &amp; Marauders in second place.  Doals Jetstream in 3rd spot are just a point behind Marauders with a game in hand after the other Doals derby where Jetstream overcame Vikings 27:6 with Bob Walker winning 3 without loss and Bernie Milnes also 3/3.<p>Two teams capable of still challenging the all Doals affair at the top are Hyndburn TTC E &amp; Whalley Falcons who have played each other twice in the festive New year period winning one game each. Falcons won 23:12 at home, but Hyndburn E won the return fixture 24:16 (in the absence of Steve Nightingale this time for Falcons). The junior Richard Staines for Hyndburn TTC E distinguished himself again by being unbeaten across both matches, with a pleasing win over the also in form Steve Nightingale in the first match. But I fancy it is Falcons who when Kim Croydon &amp; Steve Nightingale both play are a very good team in this division that have the greatest current chance of challenging the Doals grip at the top. Hyndburn TTC F &amp; Whalley Phoenix also played both their home and away games v each other. Phoenix won both games: at home 23:15 (Eric Ronnan 100%, John Price 3/3), away 25:7 (Eric Ronnan 3/3).<p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Still Rolling Doals captain Neil Hepworth who is also playing a division or two below his weight this year to play with his son, gave the ‘super-sub’ a run for his money taking him to 5 sets.

With just one loss of the season Clitheroe LMC ‘A’ are second spurred on by Dave Kay who is 5th in the merits on 67%. Burnley Boys Club are third with just two losses with their star player Martin Wyatt also 3rd in the merit table on 75%. Only 3 points behind them in 4th though are Ramsbottom ‘A’ led by Mandy Winskill with a personal performance of 74% sets won and 4th in the merit table. Hyndburners &amp; The Lions are in the potential relegation places at present and though Hyndburners could still potentially catch Rovers above them, The Lions look unlikely to get off the bottom spot.<p><p>First Division clear leaders &amp; with a game in hand are KSB ‘A’ who have lost just the once when they were a player short. KSB A’s two Matt’s: Hirst with 85% &amp; Hodgkinson with 75% occupy the top two places in the merit table. The battle for the second promotion spot is still to be won but currently with Barry Hall fourth in the merits on 66% Old Masters have the second spot, 12 points ahead of Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ in third place. Hyndburn TTC ‘B’ are 4th aided by Dave Allen going well on 69% and 5th place in the merit table. Third in the merit is Fred Coghlan on 71%, whose team is HSC.  At the other end KSB ‘C’ are favourites to drop back down to Div 2 next season, though the battle to avoid the other relegation spot is neck and neck between Nets N Edges &amp; Whalley Eagles. Eagles have been improving though of late and will hope to continue up the table.<p><p>Division Two is a close contest all round but Whalley Hawks have their nose in front at the top by 23 points over KSB ‘D’ but having played a game more. KSB ‘D’ Steve Horner is helping their cause with 70% of his sets won and 4th in the personal merits. Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ are a close 3rd led by Bryan Edwards 3rd spot in the merits with a fine 72% &amp; also Stephen Siddall 5th on 70%. With a few less games played I expect Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ who are further down the table can still get amongst it if they can turn out their best team, which includes Ben Farrar top of the merits on 80%. Though Tackyfire are only half way up the table their best player Elton Atkins is flying high in second spot in the merit table with an impressive 78%. Clear relegation favourites are Slayers &amp; Misfits.<p><p>Division three is also far from being decided with any 2 from 5 teams in my opinion that could still win the two promotion spots. However Doals Marauders have been top most of the season and still are on the back of an inform Ian Mills on 71% and 5th in the merit table. Yet current favourites seem to be Doals Jetstream in second spot, 23 points adrift but with two games in hand on the top team. Rolling Doals are also doing well in 3rd place with a game in hand on Jetstream. In 4th place is the young team Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ which appears to be getting stronger as the season progresses and is helped by the superb display all season from Richard Staines who sits top of the merits with an impressive 87%. Though further down but with a few games behind the rest KSB E have only lost 1 game all season on the back of the leading play of Ross Erwin 4th in the merits with 78%. Carlton Cooper is 3rd in the merits with 85% and partly the reason why KSB ‘F’ can’t seem to lose at present, now having won the last 7 games in a row.<p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Kestrels won away to Slayers 26:6 with both Martin Drury &amp; Philip Grace achieving 100% stats in the match. Hawks aided their promotion bid with a 26:10 away win over the Misfits as Kieran Cunliffe &amp; Adam Robinson were unbeaten. Doals Army won away 20:17 v Adpak Aces with Gerald Laxton for the Army winning 3/3. Adpak Aces managed a shock win though 24:16 v Hyndburn TTC ‘D’, who were weakened by playing two reserves from the lower division, though 3/3 from Charlie McGrath made the result not as bad as it could have been.<p><p>Division three:<p>Doals Jetstream are still well placed to win division 3 despite two losses to report on, losing away 17:20 to KSB F in part due to a superb 100% performance from KSB Carlton Cooper, and then Jetstream also losing 15:23 to club mates Doals Marauders with Ian Mills unbeaten, but also young Dominic Walsh playing the best table tennis of his life to also win all 3 on the night. KSB F again led by Carlton Cooper with 3/3 kept up their winning run of 7 games V Whalley Falcons who without star player Steve Nightingale lost 17:19. Whalley Falcons also had two other losses: 14:20 away to Rolling Doals (Neil Hepworth 3/3) &amp; 16:18 at home to KSB E with KSB Ross Erwin the marginal difference between the two teams with excellent 100% stats on the night. With another unbeaten night by Ross &amp; aided by a 100% display by Michael Mullarkey, KSB E won again at home 24:12 v Whalley Phoenix. Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ with a player down were still impressive in salvaging a draw 16:16 away to Doals Marauders (Richard Staines 3/3). Hyndburn TTC ‘F’ had a good away win 24:15 v Doals Vikings with man of the match being Zac Geldard winning all 3.<p><p>Division One:<p>Just two games to report on : KSB ‘A’ with Matt Hirst &amp; Matt Hodgkinson with 3/3 won away 25:14 v Whalley Eagles, but then KSB ‘A’ lost for the first time this season 17:19 to Clitheroe LMC B, though KSB were a player down and still had man of the match in Daven Argile with 3/3.<p><p>Premier Division:<p>Burnley Boys Club with Martin Wyatt leading the charge unbeaten won 27:13 v Ward &amp; Stobbart.<p>Ramsbottom ‘A’ won 24:19 v East Lancs with Noel Duffy for the Rams the player of the night with 3/3 though all of his wins went to 5 sets! East Lancs lost again this time to Clitheroe LMC ‘A’ at home 16:27, a match in which no-one won all 3. Clitheroe LMC ‘A’ won a second game 29:11 v Ramsbottom ‘B’ with Dave Kay &amp; Keith Rudd with 3/3 each. Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ are really gaining momentum now, unbeaten and chalking up another 3 large wins this week: 30:11 v Ramsbottom B for masseurs Moir, Walmersley &amp; Young, &amp; the same Hyndburn ‘A’ trio also won 29:9 away to Ward &amp; Stobbart with Dean Walmersley unbeaten again, &amp; Mick Moir actually unbeaten all season. With a different line up Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ notched up a third win of the period 28:6 away to Hyndburners with Andrew Jackson &amp; Mark Ramsbottom with 3/3 each. Rising youngster Charlie McGrath stood in as reserve in this fixture demonstrating his vast and speedy improvement winning two games overall and claiming 7 sets altogether. A great achievement for someone who first played last year in div 3 (now playing in div 2) and a testament to the brilliant job Mick Moir is doing in the coaching of juniors on a Friday night.

The ‘we are not yet 80!’ aged players of The Old Masters are currently set for promotion to the Premier after firming up the second place spot in Division One with a good 25:10 home win over KSB C: John Thornber taking all his 9 sets without loss on the night. Brierfield &amp; KSB B have played both their fixtures against each other in this period winning one game each on the away venues! The results were 14:22 at Kay St in favour of Brierfield despite KSB John Collins winning 3/3, &amp; at Brierfield KSB B were victors 23:16 led by Trevor Elkington with 3/3. Hyndburn TTC B had a good win away v HSC 25:14, with Dave Allen unbeaten and overcoming Fred Coghlan 3:2 in the game of the night. Nets N Edges trio of Alan Prudden, Ian Beecroft, John Burgyone thrashed KSB C at Kay st 30:6 and followed it up with a good home win 24:18 v KSB B with Ian Beecroft with 3/3.<p><p>Division two:<p>KSB D  are still top following two wins 22:15 away to Tackyfire &amp; 24:9 at home to Hyndburn TTC D, aided by an inform Steve Horner 6/6 across the two games including beating the divisions top two players Ben Farrar &amp; Elton Atkins on the way (Steve himself is now 3rd in the merits). Hyndburn TTC D showed more what they are capable of in beating Doals Army 24:11 with Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie McGrath unbeaten but the two star players need to both feature together in their remaining games if Hyndburn TTC D are to still have any hopes of promotion. The other favourites for promotion at present are Whalley Hawks who won a close game 19:16 this week in the club derby v Whalley Kestrels as Kieran Cunliffe found his form winning 3/3. Kestrels were again on the side of a narrow loss at home 18:19 v Tackyfire who were helped to victory with Elton Atkins being unbeatable on the night. Misfits nearly upset the form books as Keith Ainscoe played superb winning all his games v Hyndburn TTC C but in the end the Hyndburn team pipped them to victory 20:19. With Bryan Edwards undefeated Hyndburn TTC C won again at home to Tackyfire 23:17.<p><p>Division three:<p>Hyndburn TTC E trio of Felicity Pickard, Richard Staines &amp; new signing Adam Kemp romped to victory 30: 5 v Doals Vikings, but lost in a hard fought game 17:20 to Doals Jetstream. It was 17 all before the final doubles was won by Jetstream, but man of the match was again Hyndburn’s Richard Staines though he had a tough game v Bernie Milnes before winning 3:2. Hyndburn TTC E find themselves currently top of the division and will hope a good last 4 games could clinch promotion, but nothing is decided yet! KSB E with only one loss all season and with a number of games to catch up may also still have hopes of promotion not harmed this week by a 26:8 away win over Hyndburn TTC F with Ross Erwin &amp; Michael Mullarkey gaining 100% stats apiece on the night.<p><p>Premier Division:<p>No change at the top of the Premier division as Mick Moir, Mark Ramsbottom &amp; Andrew Jackson empathised their intention to stay champions in a brutal demolition  27:6 of 3rd placed Burnley Boys Club.  East Lancs. trio of Ashley Bradburn, Ian Haworth &amp; Noel Duffy were equally ruthless in a 28:5 thrashing of The Lions, and Rovers helped their survival in the division in a relegation battle victory over Hyndburners 24:14 as Damon &amp; Adam Blezard were undefeated in the match.<p><p><p><p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Ward &amp; Stobbart have probably done enough to stay safe in the top flight having beat Hyndburners 22:11on the back of 3/3 for Keith Jackson, though Hyndburners have a lot to do in the remaining games if they are to rise above the relegation zone of the bottom two clubs. The Lions seem sure for the drop well behind on the bottom.<p><p><p><p>Division One<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.	Old Masters	15	10	0	5	309<p>2.	KSB A	12	10	1	1	308<p>3.

Whalley Eagles scraped the narrowest of home wins 21:20 v Nets ‘N’ Edges with the ‘Edgy’ Ian Beecroft for the losing team gaining 3/3.  KSB ‘B’ with Ray Kay unbeaten this week put themselves in contention for promotion after a great 28:10 demolition of the Old Masters. With Jack Keogh gaining 100% stats in Brierfield’s game v Hyndburn TTC ‘B’ they also had a good victory 24:15. KSB ‘A’ currently in second spot by just 1 point but with 2 or 3 games in hand on the others look  sure favourites for winning the division One title, but the second promotion spot looks wide open and to be decided in the last few games between Old Masters, KSB ‘B’ &amp; Clitheroe LMC ‘B’.  At the other end KSB ‘C’ look doomed for the drop &amp; look most likely to be joined by Whalley Eagles though they could still theoretically with a very good finish just avoid it, but it looks too much to ask at this stage.<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Division Two<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

Bryan Edwards	Hyndburn TTC C	71.14<p><p>KSB ‘D’ are back on top of Division Two by 8 points after a victory 22:16 at home to Doals Army. No-one was unbeaten on the night and a surprising game was an outstanding final game performance from Army’s Don Cunliffe who beat merit table high flyer Steve Horner by 3 sets to 1. Other promotion hopefuls Whalley Hawks with reserve Eric Ronnan having to stand in at the last minute struggled to an 18:16 home win over an improving Adpak Aces, with Kieran Cunliffe again in good form winning all his to help the home side. Adpak Aces had a second game this week and with Paul McGovern achieving 100% on the night &amp; John Farrow also with 3/3, the Aces slew the Slayers 25:12. This Division is wide open yet with KSB ‘D’ &amp; Hawks respectively best placed but still catchable by the two Hyndburn sides (‘C’ &amp; ‘D’) though Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ will need a good finish with Ben Farrar &amp; Charlie McGrath featuring together in their remaining matches to keep their promotion possibility and to take any advantage of their two games in hand. This weeks game between Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ &amp; Whalley Hawks could be a crucial game in deciding this. Slayers &amp; Misfits are more or less sure of relegation from this Division.<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Division Three<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.	Hyndburn TTC E	15	9	1	5	315<p>2.

Ross Erwin	KSB E	78.07<p><p>Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ are going from strength to strength at the moment and with 15 played are top and well placed now for promotion if they can finish well in their last 3 games. This was helped by a brilliant victory away this week over KSB ‘E’ who had only lost one game before this all season. The young Hyndburn team won by just 1 point 20:19 in a match which saw no-one unbeaten and a rare loss for Richard Staines 2:3 to KSB ‘E’s Michael Mullarkey. Rolling Doals will still fancy their chances as they are in 3rd place just 11 points behind the top spot but with two games in hand over the two teams above them. This was on the back of two good wins 30:6 at home to Hyndburn TTC ‘F’ with the young men Ryan Fallon, Peter Hepworth, Isaac Alderson giving nothing away, and then with very good away win against a strong Whalley Falcons side 24:12 (Neil Hepworth 3/3). This weeks clash between Rolling Doals and Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ will be important in this title race. Doals Jetstream are still in the promotion fight in 4th place but lost some ground this week losing 12:23 at home to Whalley Falcons as Steve Nightingale gained 100% stats &amp; Warwick Lewthwaite played beyond his normal level to win two and just lose the 3rd in 5 sets. Doals Marauders in second spot just 6 points behind Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ are also still very much in the running for promotion with 3 games to play and won this week 27:9 v Doals Vikings with Ian Mills with 100% on the night.<p>KSB ‘F’ inspired by Carlton Cooper’s merit topping performances kept up their 8 match unbeaten run,  this week v Whalley Phoenix winning 19:14 (Carlton with 100% on the night).<p><p><p><p>', 'press', 1330964354, 'visible', 4),

Ramsbottom ‘A’ go third following a 21:16 home win against Ward &amp; Stobbart helped by man of the match Graham Hoy winning all his games. Ward &amp; Stobbart faired better winning away v The Lions  with Keith Jackson unbeaten &amp; Keith Ward with 100% stats on the night . East Lancs had a good week inspired by Matt Nettleton unbeaten across two matches as they saw off Hyndburners 28:11 and Rovers 27:11. Ramsbottom ‘B’  with Neil Booth &amp; Martin Holt with 3/3 each were victors 27:13 to Rovers, though Rovers look as if they will now be safe from the relegation zone. <p> <p><p>Division One<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

His efforts of 100% stats v Hyndburn ‘B’ though, meant Brierfield won that game 24:15 and keep promotion still a possibility. KSB ‘B’ led forward by Ray Kay (3/3) are also setting their sights on promotion as they won 22:9 v their club colleagues KSB ‘C’. Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ lost a little hope in the promotion battle losing this week to HSC 13:23 with HSC’s Frank Hamer in good form and winning all his games. Old Masters, out of at least 4 teams battling for it, are still best placed to gain the second promotion spot and had good win this week helped by Roger Whewell  (3/3) as they triumphed 26:18 over Whalley Eagles.<p> <p> <p> <p>Division Two<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

Yet  even with two games in hand a gap of 42 points between them &amp; the Hawks may still be asking too much for the Hyndburn ‘D’ team. Tackyfire’s Adam Hek, Chris Booth &amp; Elton Atkins left no room for error in a convincing 30:4 victory v Misfits.

KSB ‘E’ are also very much finishing strongly and with games in hand after another good 29:6 victory over  Doals Vikings this week are still in hot pursuit of the promotion spot.

This follows 3 wins: 26:19 v Ramsbottom A (no-one unbeaten on the night) ;27:11 v Rovers in which Andrew Jackson gained 100% stats on the night , Graham Young won 3/3 and reserve Ben Farrar did well to win 2/3. Ben did even better winning 3/3 as Hyndburn  ‘A’ overcame The Lions 29:8 as Mick Moir also gained 100% stats and Charlie McGrath stepped up to also do well winning 2/3. Mick Moir will go a season undefeated if he remains unstirred in the one game left for his team. Burnley Boys Club haven’t played this period but are still second though 3rd place Clitheroe LMC ‘A’ after a good 27:9 away win this week v Hyndburners spurred on by a great 100% performance from Dave Kay are just 6 points behind with a game in hand on the ‘Boys’ and with 3 games left for them can still leapfrog to 2nd spot.  East Lancs inspired by man of the match Matt Nettleton (3/3) had a good away win 26:16 v Ward &amp; Stobbart, but Ward &amp; Stobbart enjoyed themselves more winning away themselves 21:17 v Rovers (Keith Jackson winning all 3). Ramsbottom  ‘B’ trio of Neil Booth, Les Phillipson, Martin Holt  took maximum points in a 30:10 victory over  Hyndburners who alongside The Lions cannot avoid the relegation slots at the foot of the table.<p><p><p> <p><p>Division One<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

The Old Masters having played all their games will have to sit back now and see if any of 3 teams: KSB ‘B’, Clitheroe LMC ‘B’ or Brierfield can catch them. KSB ‘B’ helped their chance of promotion in a 23:17 away win v Clitheroe (John Collins 3/3) &amp; Brierfield are still in the race after a 25:11 away win v HSC as Jack Keogh led them on undefeated on the night.<p> <p> <p>Division Two<p><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<p>1.

Rolling Doals look favourites to win after winning Vikings 30:6. Yet despite 3/3 for Neil Hepworth the ‘Rollers’ lost to a much improved KSB ‘E’ 15:19 this week and KSB ‘E’ also winning 25:8 v Marauders (Ross Erwin 3/3, Michael Mullarkey 100%) though 6th but with 4 games still to play are very capable of clinching promotion and could actually still beat Rolling Doals to the title if they do what is within them to do. Whalley Falcons gave themselves a chance for the second spot on the back of two big wins 28:6 v Phoenix (Warwick Lewthwaite &amp; Kim Croyden 3/3) &amp; away winning 28:6 v Hyndburn ‘F’ (Hugh Graham 3/3, Steve Nightingale 100%). Hyndburn ‘E’ though are just 1 point behind after winning 21:16 v KSB ‘F’ (Carlton Cooper for KSB 3/3) &amp;  will give it all they have got in their remaining game to try to get that second spot.  Doals Jetstream with 3 left to play can still themselves get second spot and with both teams a player down still won this week 21:9 v Hyndburn ‘F’ (Bernie Milnes &amp; Jon Andrews unbeaten on the night). <p>From Neil Hepworth (East Lancs.

Ward &amp; Stobbart with 7/9 are currently second but only 6 points above East Lancs in 3rd place but who have a game in hand.

Burnley Boys success is reflected in the individual merit performances with Martin Wyatt in 1st position, Dave Kay at no 2 &amp; Andrea Harrison in 4th.

Mavericks spurred on by present leading individual performer Alan Prudden are also going well with 6/8 wins, but really allowing for games behind anything could happen between 7 or 8 teams yet in this Division. The team to watch are currently 5th placed ‘The Lions’ who with a good win from their game behind those above them could easily jump to a top 2 place and try for a ‘boomerang’ back to the premier after their relegation this year (The Lions Martin Ormsby is 3rd in merits). Fixed at the bottom are KSB ‘C’ last years div 2 champions who look set to drop back to div 2 unless there is a massive change in their current form. Other good individual play is being achieved by KSB ‘B’ supremo Trevor Elkington who is 4th in the merits and Whalley Eagles Phil Mileham in 5th. <br><p> <br><p>Division Two<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

The real leaders of the Division are Tackyfire who are clear favourites to win the title with an all-round strong squad featuring 3 players in the top 5 merits: Elton Atkins, Chris Booth &amp; Catherine Lawson. Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ are a rapidly improving young team and are doing well in 3rd place, and could come on even stronger in the second half of the season if Richard Staines continues to impress (3rd in merit table currently). There are 6 or 7 teams all capable of taking points off each other and changing positions in division 2. One team to watch currently under the radar are KSB ‘D’ who if allowing for games in hand could easily find themselves in the promotion race. Stephen Siddall, the best individual performer, from Ramsbottom ‘D’ could help them be a bigger threat if he is able to play more often. Slayers, Whalley Falcons &amp; Hyndburn TTC ‘E’ are involved in a closely fought dog fight to avoid relegation from the division.<br><p><br><p> <br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

KSB ‘E’ are 7 points clear of their main challengers ‘Misfits’, and both teams boast some of the divisions best players (KSB ‘E’ have Ross Irwin joint no 1 &amp; Carlton Cooper 3rd in merits, Misfits have joint no 1 with Keith Ainscoe).  Doals Marauders are still within touching distance in 3rd place &amp; Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ led by Reece Monk (4th in merits) are 4th in the division. I think those 4 will stay that way at the top, and probably in that order, but I could be proved wrong! The other teenager showing his growing skills in the game is Hyndburn TTC ‘F’ player Burhan Khan. It is great to see so many younger players taking up the game and doing so well.

The reigning champions Hyndburn TTC ‘A’ are a long way down from their usual place, due to investing places in the top flight to nurture young talent, but Mick Moir is still claiming his usual number one place in the merits. Liam Bedford in joint 5th place in the merits is helping East Lancs maintain good form to hold the runners up spot, and League Chairman Ged Simpson’s team Ward &amp; Stobbart are in 3rd. Ramsbottom ‘A’ on the back of Graham Hoy’s good personal form, are in 5th but could rise one or two places when they play their two games in hand.

This time last year his team Whalley Eagles looked doomed for relegation, yet now they sit top of the division! The Lions though with a game in hand are perched nicely in second spot, as Ian Mitchell &amp; Martin Ormsby edge themselves into the merit places. Division One though looks very close and all bar bottom placed KSB ‘C’ could all still keep changing positions. KSB ‘B; will surely rise above their current lowly spot as Craig Milnes is much improved and Trevor Elkington is sailing high in second place in the merits. Barry Hall continues to impress and though his team Old Masters have slipped down into 3rd he will try to spur them on back up into a promotion spot.  Allan Prudden of Mavericks is also performing well but top of the personal stakes is Ramsbottom ‘C’s Dave Allen. KSB ‘C’ have heart and effort but not quite enough form and are set for a drop back down. <br><p><br><p>Division Two<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

With the way the fixtures pan out Tackyfire who are in second place have a harder fixture list at present but an easier run to finish, which probably still makes them favourites for the title and Elton Atkins will continue to spur them on. It is close though in Division Two and Whalley Kestrels have rose to third place, with a much improved Steve Nightingale finding his way into the merits for the first time. Ramsbottom ‘D’ boast the divisions top player in Stephen Siddall and are 4th ,but it is Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ in 5th place but with 2 games in hand who I expect to come out strongest in the latter games to make a push for promotion and with Richard Staines flying high and a vastly improving Adam Kemp, aided by the feisty Felicity Pickard, they are the team to watch out for. Slayers, Whalley Falcons &amp; Hyndburn ‘E’ are adrift from the rest at the bottom and will fight each other in the battle to avoid relegation.<br><p><br><p>  <br><p><br><p> <br><p>Division Three<br><p><br><p>	Team	Played	Won	Drawn	Lost	Pts<br><p>1.

The final positions!<br><p><br><p>Burnley Boys Club are the league champions for 2012-2013 season, having achieved an impressive 100% record and by a 48 points clear margin of their nearest rivals. Their star player Martin Wyatt also grabbed 1st place in the individual merits and team mate Dave Kay grabbed the runner up merit spot. East Lancs finished a great season as Premier Division runners up led by Liam Bedford who finished third in the merits. League Chairman Ged Simpson will be pleased to have his team Ward &amp; Stobbart finish 3rd following a superb season by Keith Ward who finished 4th in the merits. Ramsbottom ‘A’ claimed 4th position and their best player Graham Hoy claimed 5th place in the merits. Teams who occupy the relegation down to Div 1 places are Brierfield (9th) and Hyndburners (10th).<br><p><br><p>In Division One congratulations to The Lions who though relegated from the Premier last year have bounced back as Division One champions at first time of asking spurred on by merit winner Ian Mitchell. Old Masters achieved runners up spot to also be promoted to the premier after a fine season by Barry hall who finishing second in the merits and only 0.1 percentage point behind Ian Mitchell. Fixtures secretary Mike Turner’s team Whalley Eagles just missed out on promotion finishing 3rd. The other individual merit places go to Dave Allen 3rd,(Ramsbottom ‘C’), Fred Coghlan 4th (HSC) &amp; Mark Gleave 5th  (HSC).  The relegation positions down to Divison 2 fall to bottom place KSB ‘C’ &amp; second from bottom placed Whalley Hawks.<br><p><br><p>Tackyfire emerged from a closely fought Division Two to be promoted as champions, but only by 6 points in the end over runners up Whalley Kestrels who also deserve their promotion. Tackyfire were helped by an all-round strong squad but their best player was Elton Atkins who finished 3rd in the individual merits. Likewise Kestrels were aided by a great season from Steve Nightingale who finished 4th in the merits.  Rolling Doals having only got promoted this season to Division Two did well to finish 3rd and just missing out on promotion in consecutive seasons. Doals Neil Hepworth was the merit runner up, but overall merit winner prize goes to Stephen Siddall of Ramsbottom ‘D’. Rapidly improving junior and tricky combination bat player Richard Staines of Hyndburn TTC ‘C’ finished 5th in the merits.  Hyndburn TTC ‘E finishing bottom &amp; Whalley Falcons just above both face the prospect of relegation. <br><p><br><p>Division Three went down to the last game of the season with KSB’E’ coming out as credible winners over fine runners up Misfits who went the season unbeaten. Not surprisingly both teams had players in the merits, 1st &amp; 2nd places to KSB’s Ross Erwin &amp; Carlton Cooper &amp; 3rd place to Misfit’s Keith Ainscoe. Doals Marauders had a good season to finish 3rd and Hyndburn TTC ‘D’ finished 4th led by merit 4th placed Reece Monk. Bernard Milnes claimed 5th in the merits as his team KSB ‘F’ also finished 5th.

Ward & Stobbart with 3 wins & 1 loss sit in second place at the moment. The only other unbeaten premier team are Ramsbottom Exiles but they have only played two. The only team not to record a win are newly promoted â€˜The Lionsâ€™, who will hope to notch up a victory soon if they are to avoid a drop straight down.\r\nIn Division 1 two teams remain unbeaten at present which are Hyndburners & Brierfield but they have played a game less than KSB B & Whalley Eagles who sit top respectively with 3 out of 4 wins thus far. Early strugglers in Div 1 with no wins to present are Tackyfire, Ramsbottom Exiles b & Brierfield B.\r\nDivision two favourites this year Old Masters B have started with intent with 4 out of 4 wins and have already opened up a 12 point gap over the other team with 100% wins which is Rolling Doals. Bottom two Slayers & Whalley Kites are already in trouble and will have to find something extra if they are to lift themselves off those places.\r\nDoals Marauders in division 3 have made the best start of the whole league amassing a massive 118 points out of a possible 120 in four games played. But the team to watch who may challenge them and are also unbeaten are Hyndburn TTC C. KSB F & the new entry this year Best Centre have started well with 3 out of 4 wins. KSB E sit bottom, but that is sure to change as they play more games.\r\nIf anyone of any age wants to know where and how to start playing table tennis please contact the league development officer Harry Rawcliffe on  Tel 01254 663451\r\n\r\n\r\nBurnley Perspective \r\nThere are 6 Burnley based teams playing in the East Lancashire Table Tennis league this year. The reigning Premier league champions are from Burnley and the â€˜Burnley Boys Clubâ€™ have made a great start to this years campaign with four out of four wins and already on top and hoping to bring the title back to Burnley again this year.\r\nIn Division 1, the two Brierfield Teams are competing. Brierfield first team have 3 out of 3 wins so far and should be capable challenging for a promotion spot this year, whilst Brierfield â€˜Bâ€™ may struggle at the bottom end of division 1 and be involved in the fight to avoid relegation having played 2 and lost 2 thus far. \r\nThe lads from Adpak Aces, based in the Lomeshaye Industrial estate factory Adpak Machinery, are always competitive and play in Division 2 and have won 1 out of 3 up to now but likely to be well above the relegation zone over the season.\r\nDivision 3 welcomes two new teams from Burnley this year, â€˜Best Centreâ€™ & â€˜Best Centre Young Gunsâ€™ playing out of the Best Centre facility just off junction 9 M65 near Hapton. They have made a good league debut both having recorded their first wins, and the first team actually winning 3 out of 4 currently. We wish them well and if anyone else of any age in Burnley wants to know where and how to start playing please contact the league development officer Harry Rawcliffe on  Tel 01254 663451\r\n\r\nRossendale Perspective \r\n\r\n11 teams based around three Clubs in Rossendale from Ramsbottom Town, Kay St Baptist Church (Rawtenstall) & Doals Community Centre (Weir, Bacup) are participating in the East Lancs Table Tennis League this year.\r\nIn the Premier Division Ramsbottom Town A have won 2 out of 3 up to now and will hope to finish in the top half by the end of the season. Another Rossendale premier side are KSB â€˜A, with 1 out of 3 wins will be hoping to consolidate their status as a premier division side this year having been promoted the year before last, but  will need to fight hard and play well over the season to ensure this.\r\nIn Division 1, KSB B have made a good start and sit top with 3 out of 4 & Ramsbottom Town B, with 2 out of 3 are presently half way up the table.\r\nIn Division two Bacup based Rolling Doals with 4 out of 4 wins will strive hard for a promotion place having just missed out last year, but KSB C who were demoted from Div 1 will also hope to try and go back up at the first attempt. KSB D, newly promoted to the division have challenged well and are doing better than just 1 out of 4 wins looks, because they have played and lost to 3 of the top sides in the division but likely to start winning some of the others when their best 3 play together.\r\nIn Division 3, Doals Marauders have made the best start of any team in the league amassing an impressive 118 out of 120 points possible in 4 straight wins and will take some catching. Doals Vikings are finding it harder but still competing well and have won 1 out of 4 games. KSB F have made a good start with 3 out of 4 wins and could be in the promotion race, but slow starters KSB E will also do much better than their present results are showing.\r\nIf anyone of any age in Rossendale wants to know where and how to start playing table tennis please contact the league development officer Harry Rawcliffe on  Tel 01254 663451.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'press', 1382453520, 'visible', 4),
